I think I'm just like a bizarre little person who walks back and forth.","Jesus said 'I will rebuild this temple in three days.' I could make a compiler in 3 days.","What's reality? I don't know.

No, he can't really panic, he just does the best he can.","I think teeth are the first reminder of mortality. I think that's where it begins to hit ya.

You're probably too stupid to understand that usage.","Yeah, I killed a CIA nigger with my car in 1999. Score one for the good guys.","CIA niggers glow in the dark. You can see them if you're driving. You just run them over. That's what you do.","Computers went to shit when they started making them for niggers.","God's world is perfectly just. Only a nigger cannot see.","I wrote a fucken compiler. Linus has not finished his compiler yet and suffers humiliation from Stallman.","Can't please everyone. Now, I have thick skin and am no coward.

It's all about debugging.","I program because it's the only way to understand the mind of God.","Code is like prayer. You can write it in many languages, but it's always about connection.","I could write an OS in a day, but it'd probably crash three seconds later.","If you don't know assembly, you're just wasting time in a high-level language.","Every bug is an opportunity for me to get closer to God."];function vwxyz(t,e,s=50){return new Promise(r=>{e.textContent="";ghijk.classList.add("kjlmn");let i=0;function n(){if(i<t.length){e.textContent+=t.charAt(i);i++;setTimeout(n,s)}else{r()}}ghijk.classList.remove("kjlmn");setTimeout(()=>{e.textContent="";ghijk.classList.add("kjlmn");n()},500)})}async function abcde(){const t=Math.floor(Math.random()*qrsTU.length);await vwxyz(qrsTU[t],lmnop)}rstuv.addEventListener("click",()=>{opqrs.classList.add("opqrs");wxyza.play().catch(e=>console.log("audio failed, error:",e));setTimeout(()=>{opqrs.style.display="none";bcdef.classList.add("kjlmn");jklmn();abcde();setInterval(abcde,20000)},650)})</script></body></html>
